Welcome to the Alnojoom Elsabaa mobile application, provided by Alnojoom Elsabaa Security & Surveillance System Installation L.L.C. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our fleet management application.
<br />
### Information Collected:
Alnojoom Elsabaa only collects login credentials, which include a username and password. This information is solely used for the purpose of logging into the application to provide users with access to their fleet management data. No other personal information is collected.
<br/>
### Permissions:
The app requests the following permission:
<br/>
#### INTERNET: 
This permission is required to enable the app to connect to the internet for user authentication and to retrieve the necessary data for the functionality of the application.
<br/>
#### PUSH NOTIFICATIONS:
This permission is needed, so that we can send you notifications whenever an alert about the vehicle tracking device is raised. This can include exceeding speed limit and turning the engine on/off.
<br />
#### USER LOCATION:
This permission is optional. It is not required at all to access any of the app's functionality. However, the user can allow the app to use the location if they prefer to see an indicator of their location on the live map page. It is completely optional otherwise.
<br />
If the user does permit the app to use the location, the app only uses it to show the user their location on the live map and their data is not used, processed or transmitted in any way shape or form. It is not transmitted to any service whether that is our servers, third party servers or otherwise. In simpler terms, the user's location data does not leave their device.
